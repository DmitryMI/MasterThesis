	abstract = {The process of routing in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) is a challenging task in city environments. Finding the shortest end-to-end connected path satisfying delay restriction and minimal overhead is confronted with many constraints and difficulties. Such difficulties are due to the high mobility of vehicles, the frequent path failures, and the various obstructions, which may affect the reliability of the data transmission and routing. Commercial Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or what are commonly referred to as drones can come in handy in dealing with these constraints. In this paper, we study how UAVs operating in ad hoc mode can cooperate with VANET on the ground so as to assist in the routing process and improve the reliability of the data delivery by bridging the communication gap whenever it is possible. In a previous work, we have proposed UVAR – a UAV-Assisted VANETs routing protocol, which improves data routing and connectivity of the vehicles on the ground through the use of UAVs. However, UVAR does not fully exploit UAVs in the sky for data forwarding because it uses UAVs only when the network is poorly dense. In this paper, we propose an extension of this protocol by supporting two different ways of routing data: (i) delivering data packets exclusively on the ground using UVAR-G; and (ii) transmitting data packets in the sky using a reactive routing based on UVAR-S. Simulation results demonstrate that the hybrid communication between vehicles and UAVs is ideally suited for VANETs compared to traditional vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications.}

Veins already includes a full stack of simulation models for investigating cars and infrastructure communicating via IEEE 802.11 based technologies in simulations of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Thanks to its modularity, though, it can equally well be used as the basis for modeling other mobile nodes (like bikes or pedestrians) and communication technologies (from mobile broadband to visible light). Serving as the basis for hundreds of publications and university courses since its beginnings in the year 2006, today Veins is both one of the most mature and established tools in this domain.",

Currently available software tools for VANET research still lack the ability to asses the usability of vehicular applications. In this article, we present <u>Tra</u>ffic <u>C</u>ontrol <u>I</u>nterface (TraCI) a technique for interlinking road traffic and network simulators. It permits us to control the behavior of vehicles during simulation runtime, and consequently to better understand the influence of VANET applications on traffic patterns.In contrast to the existing approaches, i.e., generating mobility traces that are fed to a network simulator as static input files, the online coupling allows the adaptation of drivers' behavior during simulation runtime. This technique is not limited to a special traffic simulator or to a special network simulator. We introduce a general framework for controlling the mobility which is adaptable towards other research areas.We describe the basic concept, design decisions and the message format of this open-source architecture. Additionally, we provide implementations for non-commercial traffic and network simulators namely SUMO and ns2, respectively. This coupling enables for the first time systematic evaluations of VANET applications in realistic settings.},
