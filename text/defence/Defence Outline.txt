Small presentation about your thesis and your results. 
The final talk should be 20min - 30min (maximum) long.

Presentation

1. Motivation
	1. Cities of the future will be populated by autonomous vehicles and drones
	2. Most other works focus on other aspects: network architecture, infrastructure integration, drone pathfinding, drone allocation, etc.
	3. Very few works discuss urban environments
	
2. Goals
	In my work I assess the benefits of using drones in order to spread traffic information between vehicles in the urban environment
	
3. Implementation
	1. Network architecture
	2. Simulation environment
	3. Protocol
	4. Drones, 3D shadowing
	5. Visualization
	
4. Evaluation
	1. Input parameters: Number of drones, number of vehicles, accident probability
	2. Received Announcements Ratio
		Can be used as network connectivity metric
		Explains all other results
	3. Traffic flow improvement: Average vehicle speed, number of jammed vehicles

5. Broadcast storm suppression
	Algorithm used
	Proof: latency, number of hops, busy time ratio
	
6. Bonus: Drone flight altitude
	Most optimal range was selected
	
7. Conclusion
	Significant improvement in urban traffic flow can be achieved
